//  Milestone E: save a person's face as a named "identity" made of one or
//  more sample embeddings, averaged into a single template vector.
//  Persisted encrypted (see SecureFaceStore) under the same Touch-ID-gated
//  session key as the stored Mac password — on-device only, nothing leaves
//  the Mac.
//
//  Because storage is now encrypted under the session key, reading/writing
//  requires an unlocked session (the same Touch ID gate Password settings
//  uses). `isLocked` and `reloadIfUnlocked()` let the UI handle that rather
//  than silently showing "no identities" when the real state is "locked."
