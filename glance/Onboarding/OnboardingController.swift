//  OnboardingController.swift
//  glance
//
//  State machine behind the notch-hosted guided onboarding flow:
//  permissions, guided nine-pose face enrollment (auto-capture as the user
//  turns/tilts their head through 8 compass directions plus center), and
//  password setup. Reuses the same camera/detection/embedding/storage
//  pieces as the Face Lab debug tab — this is a polished front door onto the
//  same on-device pipeline, not a separate implementation of it.
//
//  Still not milestone G: finishing onboarding stores an encrypted password
//  and a face template, but nothing here triggers an unlock.
