//
//  FaceUnlockCoordinator.swift

//
//  Milestone G: connects face recognition to the actual unlock path — the
//  one piece deliberately kept separate through every prior stage of this
//  project. Off by default (`isEnabled = false`); the user opts in only
//  after validating accuracy in Face Lab.
//
//  Delegates the actual keystroke injection to the existing, already-tested
//  `POCController.injectStoredPassword(requireAuthoritativeLock:)` — this
//  coordinator only decides *whether* to unlock (confident + live match),
//  never how. Mirrors POCController's own lock/wake observation pattern
//  (`withObservationTracking`, re-subscribing on every change) with its own
//  `LockMonitor` instance, since the two are deciding different things from
//  the same signal.
//
//  Drives the overlay in its "armed" mode (see NotchOverlayController): once
//  the screen locks and the feature is on, the overlay stays up for the
//  whole lock session — closed and hover-wakeable when idle, open while
//  actively scanning — until the screen unlocks or the feature is disabled.
//
//  Known limitation, surfaced in the UI, not just here: a MacBook webcam has
//  no depth sensor. `LivenessAnalyzer` (see glance/Liveness/) defeats a
//  static printed photo and, with reasonable confidence, a hand-held photo
//  on a phone screen — its signals are all built around detecting
//  non-rigid motion a flat presentation cannot produce. It does NOT defeat
//  a *video* replayed on a phone: a real video contains genuine non-rigid
//  facial motion, so nothing here distinguishes it from a live face. That
//  gap needs a dedicated presentation-attack-detection model, not more
//  geometry — weaker than iPhone Face ID in that one respect. A successful
//  spoof here types the real macOS password.
