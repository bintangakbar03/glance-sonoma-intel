//
//  NotchOverlayController.swift
//  glance
//
//  The only file other code should touch to show the notch overlay.
//
//  Two ways to drive it:
//  - One-shot (`present()` / `finish(success:)`): used by OnboardingController
//    and Face Lab's preview buttons. The window fully hides after resolving.
//  - Armed (`arm(onActivate:)` / `disarm()`): used by FaceUnlockCoordinator
//    for the real lock-screen flow. While armed, the window never actually
//    hides — it stays on-screen and shrinks to the closed notch silhouette,
//    which is what lets hovering the (visually closed) notch area wake it
//    back up. `disarm()` is the only thing that truly orders it out.
//
//  Interaction is hover-driven, not click-driven: a non-activating panel
//  needs a first click just to gain enough focus for a second click to
//  register, which is exactly the "have to double-click" bug hovering
//  avoids — hover events don't need the window to become key at all.
